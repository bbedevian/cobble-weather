√ Your app must be a single page application built with React.js and Redux

√ Use a side navigation menu to choose for which city to display weather information - choices should be New York, NY, Los Angeles, CA, and Miami, FL, with New York being the default

√ Build a fourth option that allows the user to enter the name of a city of their choosing

√ Any city should also be accessible via direct URL - e.g. accessing “/newyork” should display the same content as a click on “New York” would

√ When selecting a city, the app should display a 7-day weather forecast for that city

√ By default, each day should show a limited amount of information: day, date, temperature, & weather icon

√ Upon clicking on a day, a modal window should open a display additional information: sunset time, sunrise time, description, and wind speed

√ Allow the user to refresh the content of the forecast

? Make sure to use the user’s current time zone for dates and time

√? The title of the page should be the name of the city currently being displayed

√ Use OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data

√ Use components to build the UI

√ Use Redux Saga (redux-saga) for networking

Bonus
√ Implement loading animations to use during loading times
Use Storybook to document your components
Containerize your app using Docker
